    <h2>For Landowners</h2>

    <p>We work with landowners who are serious about making the most of what they have — not through guesswork, but through proven land management strategies.</p>

    <p><strong>Whether it's 10 acres or 1,000:</strong> we start with a walkthrough, get your goals on paper, and build a plan that fits you and the land. No fluff. No shortcuts.</p>
  
<section class="landowner-insights" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 3rem auto; padding: 0 1rem; text-align: left;">
  <h2>Most landowners don’t know what to ask — or just how much their land can give back.</h2>

    <h3>Conservation-Focused</h3>
    <p>You might not realize how much your land can support native ecosystems, restore degraded habitats, and improve water quality. With strategic planning, even small properties can become havens for biodiversity and play a meaningful role in regional conservation.</p>

  <div class="insight-block" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
    <h3>Legacy-Focused</h3>
    <p>Land ownership is a long game. Whether you're thinking about generational use, passing it to your kids, or setting up conservation easements, we help create a plan that protects your land’s value and purpose for decades to come — without sacrificing usability today.</p>

  <div class="insight-block" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
    <h3>Financial/Return-Focused</h3>
    <p>With the right management, land can become a productive asset. That means marketable timber, better soil health, enhanced recreational lease value, and long-term tax advantages. We help you tap into these without compromising the land’s integrity.</p>

  <div class="insight-block" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
    <h3>Hunting/Wildlife-Focused</h3>
    <p>Habitat is everything. If deer, turkey, or bear aren’t using your property, it’s often due to poor cover, food distribution, or pressure. We analyze movement patterns, bedding zones, food availability, and terrain to create a layout that attracts and holds game year-round.</p>
