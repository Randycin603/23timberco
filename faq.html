<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<div class="section">
  <h2>What areas do you serve?</h2>
  <p>Primarily New Hampshire and Eastern Massachusetts, but we’re open to travel for the right projects.</p>

  <h2>Do you only work on hunting properties?</h2>
  <p>No. We specialize in wildlife and forest‑based properties, and also assist landowners focused on timber, recreation, access, or resale value.</p>

  <h2>Can I hire you just for a walkthrough or plan?</h2>
  <p>Yes — advisory‑only services are available. We also offer phased work.</p>

  <h2>Do you do all the work yourself?</h2>
  <p>We self‑perform when it makes sense, and partner with trusted contractors when scale demands it.</p>

  <h2>What does a typical job cost?</h2>
  <p>From $500 consults to $50,000+ multi‑phase transformations. Scope is defined up front.</p>

  <h2>How soon can you start?</h2>
  <p>Site walks within ~2 weeks; field work depends on seasonal access, permitting, and urgency.</p>
