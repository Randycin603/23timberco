    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <section style="max-width: 800px; margin: 2rem auto; text-align: left;">
      <h3>What areas do you serve?</h3>
      <p>Primarily New Hampshire and Eastern Massachusetts, but we’re open to travel for the right projects.</p>

      <h3>Do you only work on hunting properties?</h3>
      <p>Nope. We specialize in wildlife and forest-based properties, but we also assist landowners focused on timber, recreation, access, or resale value.</p>

      <h3>Can I hire you just for a walkthrough or plan?</h3>
      <p>Yes — advisory-only services are available. We also offer phased work if you're not ready to execute everything at once.</p>

      <h3>Do you do all the work yourself?</h3>
      <p>Not always. We self-perform when it makes sense, but we also partner with trusted contractors and equipment operators when scale demands it.</p>

      <h3>What does a typical job cost?</h3>
      <p>It depends on scope. Projects range from $500 consults to $50,000+ multi-phase land transformations. We’ll always define the scope before work starts.</p>

      <h3>How soon can you start?</h3>
      <p>We try to book site walks within 2 weeks and field work based on seasonal access, permitting, and urgency. We'll be upfront about timing from day one.</p>
