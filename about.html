      <h2>Built on Experience. Backed by Science.</h2>
      <p>Land isn’t a product — it’s a system. We treat it that way.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>Too many land plans focus on a single piece of the puzzle — food plots, trails, timber — without considering how it all fits together. That fragmented approach leads to wasted effort, disappointed landowners, and poor results in the field.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>Our Approach</h3>
      <p>23 Timber Co. uses a systems-based method that combines modern habitat science with decades of practical experience. We align our work with the principles promoted by groups like the National Deer Association (NDA) and the U.S. Forest Service — without affiliation — because they represent a gold standard in effective, ethical land stewardship.</p>

      <h4>Informed by Proven Frameworks</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Timber Stand Improvement (TSI)</li>
        <li>QDM & NDA-aligned habitat plans</li>
        <li>Water, access, and cover integration</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why We're Different</h3>
      <p>This company was founded by someone with a background in executive-level construction management — where budgets matter, sequencing counts, and nothing works without a plan. We apply that same thinking to every acre we touch, whether it’s a one-acre kill plot or a 1,000-acre phased development.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>Scalable, Serious Work</h3>
      <p>We take on projects of all sizes with the same intent: to create better land, not just different land. Whether you're a landowner building legacy ground or a contractor looking for boots-on-ground intelligence, 23 Timber Co. is designed to scale — and deliver.</p>
