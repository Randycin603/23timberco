  <h2>About 23 Timber Co.</h2>
  <p>23 Timber Co. was built to address a growing problem in land management: fragmented thinking. Too often, landowners are guided to focus on one element — food plots, timber harvests, access roads — without regard for how it fits into the broader system of wildlife movement, seasonal needs, and long-term habitat health.</p>

  <p>We take a holistic approach grounded in experience and ecological principles. Every property is different, but the fundamentals remain: strategic bedding, diverse native food sources, controlled access, secure water, and timber that supports both wildlife and future value.</p>

  <p>This company was founded by someone who has spent years managing complex construction projects at the executive level while applying the same systems-based thinking to hunting land and forest planning. That blend of logistical oversight and field experience shapes every project we take on.</p>

  <p>From one-acre improvements to large-scale, multi-phase land strategies, we’re built to scale. Whether working directly with landowners or supporting contractors in the field, we bring a structured, outcomes-driven approach to every job — grounded in what works and backed by science. If you’re looking for more than a patchwork plan, 23 Timber Co. is ready to walk your land.</p>
